# Netflix-EDA

This repository includes a .html file of a jupyter notebook. Inside it, you can find the EDA of a netflix dataset along with a collection of interactive plots and visualizations.
I highly recommend downloading the .html file and opening it in a browser such as google chrome in order to properly load the notebook's interactive content.
